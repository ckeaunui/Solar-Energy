<h1>Overview</h1>
This Python script analyzes the potential solar energy generation and financial savings from solar panels for various cities and towns across the United States. 

<h1>Features</h1>
Data Retrieval: Downloads solar energy data for specified locations from NASA's POWER API.
Energy Calculation: Estimates potential solar energy generation using solar panel specifications and location-specific solar data.
Cost Analysis: Calculates potential savings and the number of panels needed to power an average household, based on state-specific energy rates.

<h1>Requirements</h1>
The script requires the following Python libraries:
pandas
requests
datetime
numpy
os
tqdm
math
sympy
glob
concurrent.futures

<h1>Input Data</h1>
City Coordinates: data/uscities.csv containing columns for city name, state, latitude, and longitude.
Energy Costs: Data/Energy_usage_per_state.csv with state energy rates and average usage.

<h1>Output Data</h1>
Solar Data: The script outputs Data/solar_data_per_city.csv, which includes solar energy generation and financial data for each city.
Usage
Configure Input/Output Paths: Ensure the input data files are located in the specified directories (data/uscities.csv and Data/Energy_usage_per_state.csv).
Run the Script: Execute the script to download and process solar data for each city.
View Results: Check the output file Data/solar_data_per_city.csv for detailed solar energy and financial analysis.


Parameters
Solar Panel Specifications:
panel_cost: Cost per solar panel (in dollars).
panel_watts: Power output of each panel (in kW).
panel_lifetime: Expected lifetime of a solar panel (in years).
panel_degradation_rate: Annual efficiency loss rate.
annual_maintenance_cost: Annual maintenance cost per panel (in dollars).
location_efficiency: Efficiency factor accounting for shading and other losses.
NASA POWER API Parameters:

parameters: Solar data parameters to query.
start_date: Start date for the data query (YYYYMMDD).
end_date: End date for the data query (YYYYMMDD).
Concurrency
The script uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently download and process data for multiple cities, improving performance and reducing execution time.
